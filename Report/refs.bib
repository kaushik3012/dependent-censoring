    abstract = "{Consider a survival time \$T\$ that is subject to random right censoring, and suppose that \$T\$ is stochastically dependent on the censoring time \$C\$. We are interested in the marginal distribution of \$T\$. This situation is often encountered in practice. Consider, for example, the case where \$T\$ is a patient’s time to death from a certain disease. Then the censoring time \$C\$ could be the time until the patient leaves the study or the time until death from another cause. If the reason for leaving the study is related to the health condition of the patient, or if the patient dies from a disease that has similar risk factors to the disease of interest, then \$T\$ and \$C\$ are likely to be dependent. In this paper we propose a new model that takes such dependence into account. The model is based on a parametric copula for the relationship between \$T\$ and \$C\$, and on parametric marginal distributions for \$T\$ and \$C\$. Unlike most other authors, we do not assume that the parameter defining the copula is known. We give sufficient conditions on these parametric copulas and marginals under which the bivariate distribution of \$(T,C)\$ is identified. These sufficient conditions are then checked for a wide range of common copulas and marginals. We also study the estimation of the model, and carry out extensive simulations and analysis on a pancreatic cancer dataset to illustrate the proposed model and estimation procedure.}",

 abstract = {This paper examines the consequences and detection of model misspecification when using maximum likelihood techniques for estimation and inference. The quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (OMLE) converges to a well defined limit, and may or may not be consistent for particular parameters of interest. Standard tests (Wald, Lagrange Multiplier, or Likelihood Ratio) are invalid in the presence of misspecification, but more general statistics are given which allow inferences to be drawn robustly. The properties of the QMLE and the information matrix are exploited to yield several useful tests for model misspecification.},

abstract = {Building on the work of Bedford, Cooke and Joe, we show how multivariate data, which exhibit complex patterns of dependence in the tails, can be modelled using a cascade of pair-copulae, acting on two variables at a time. We use the pair-copula decomposition of a general multivariate distribution and propose a method for performing inference. The model construction is hierarchical in nature, the various levels corresponding to the incorporation of more variables in the conditioning sets, using pair-copulae as simple building blocks. Pair-copula decomposed models also represent a very flexible way to construct higher-dimensional copulae. We apply the methodology to a financial data set. Our approach represents the first step towards the development of an unsupervised algorithm that explores the space of possible pair-copula models, that also can be applied to huge data sets automatically.}
