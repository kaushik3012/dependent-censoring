I would want to extend my most heartfelt thanks to everyone who made it possible for me to finish this project. My mentor on this project, Dr. Nitin Gupta, deserves a particular applaud for providing me with such an engaging opportunity.
In addition, I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisor, Silky Gupta, for the assistance she provided during the summer in the form of direction, support, and encouragement.
My parents provided consistent support and motivation for my research-based internship, and they were instrumental in establishing an atmosphere conducive to internships in our home. I'd want to express my gratitude to everyone who has helped and encouraged me.
This project provided me with the inspiration and the information that I needed to expand my interest in doing research and continuing my education.
