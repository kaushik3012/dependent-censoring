We investigate the marginal distribution of a survival time  $T$  that is subject to random right censoring, where  $T$  is stochastically dependent on the censoring time  $C$ . This scenario frequently arises in practice; for instance,  $T$  may represent the time until a patient succumbs to a specific disease, while  $C$  could denote the time until the patient withdraws from the study or dies from an unrelated cause. If the reasons for study dropout are influenced by the patientâ€™s health status or if the patient dies from a condition sharing similar risk factors with the primary disease, it is likely that  $T$  and  $C$  exhibit dependence.
To address this dependence, we replicate and validate a novel model\cite{10.1093/biomet/asac067} that utilizes a parametric copula to describe the relationship between  $T$  and  $C$ , complemented by parametric marginal distributions for both variables. Importantly, this model distinguishes itself from many existing studies by not requiring prior knowledge of the copula parameter. We establish sufficient conditions for identifying the bivariate distribution of  $(T, C)$  based on these parametric copulas and marginals, which we validate across a diverse range of common copulas and marginal distributions. Furthermore, we investigate the estimation of the model and conduct extensive simulations and analyses to evaluate its performance.
