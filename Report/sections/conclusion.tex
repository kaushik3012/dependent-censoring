\section{Conclusion}

\normalsize{
The replication of the referenced paper\cite{10.1093/biomet/asac067} has been successfully achieved. In addition, we have established the identifiability of a copula model under dependent censoring, without presuming knowledge of the copula’s association parameter. Our work also expands upon the original author’s findings by demonstrating identifiability for additional marginal distributions, specifically Exponential, Gamma, and truncated Normal distributions.

Furthermore, we can conduct additional analyses to assess the model’s sensitivity to misspecification. To enhance flexibility, we can explore semiparametric or nonparametric margins, raising the question of whether the identifiability of the model can still be assured. Additionally, we can incorporate covariates into the model. There is also considerable potential in utilizing more generalized survival models, such as competing risks models, cure models, and administrative censoring and truncation, in conjunction with dependent censoring.
